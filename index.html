      <h1 style="text-align:center; color:#FEFDEF; ">Aktau, Kazakhstan</h1>
      <p>Aktau is one of the beautiful cities located in the west of Kazakhstan in Mangystau region. Since Aktau is situated on the shores of the Caspian Sea, the main attraction here is its embankment. Also, it is an industrial region, where 25% of Kazakhstan's oil is produced. During 1961 and 1991 years, the city was called Shevchenko. The reason is that in the 19th century the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko was in exile on the territory of Kazakhstan, and the city was named after this outstanding person. </p>
